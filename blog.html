<p>Before our discussion, I would think of robots as something so futuristic like WALL-E. Now I recognize that modern technology and convience consist of robots! </p>
<p>I am excited for the future of robotoics because I want to see what else humans can create with our ever expanding knowledge and curiosity.</p>
<p>I really liked working on circuits with my groups because everything felt hands on. I want to explore more functions of circuitry.</p>
