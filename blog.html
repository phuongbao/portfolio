<p>Before our discussion, I would think of robots as something so futuristic like WALL-E. Now I recognize that modern technology and convience consist of robots! </p>
<p>I am excited for the future of robotoics because I want to see what else humans can create with our ever expanding knowledge and curiosity.</p>
<p>I really liked working on circuits with my groups because everything felt hands on. I want to explore more functions of circuitry.</p>

  <h1>What does Mauela Veloso's work have in common with Ayanna Howard's</h1>
  <p>Both of their works involve the usage of robots to better and further advance human life in research. Veloso's work involves robots learning how to interact and function like a human while Howard's work has to do with space exploration. </p>
  <h1>How did your team work together on the lightshow? How could your teamwork improve?</h1>
  <p>My team was ambitious and wanted to do a lightshow that corresponds with <em>The Office</em> theme song. Overall, we did very well. Our lights are off by half a beat, and it is hard to get it perfectly on the spot. I would say we were successful for a day's work.</p>
  <h1>What are the basic pieces of every Arduino sketch?</h1>
  <p>All Aduino sketches need a void setup() and void loop()</p>
